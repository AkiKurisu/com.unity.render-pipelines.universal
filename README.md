# AkiKurisu Universal Render Pipelines

This is a fork of universal render pipelines from [Unity Graphics](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics) for self-usage.

Since git does not support fork from a branch, custom changes will be maintained in a specific urp version of my development environment.

Currently works on URP 14.0.9 with Unity 2022.3.17.

## Notice

To facilitate migration to the new version, I will not submit any new features to this repository, but will try to add them based on Internal Bridge and SRP native methods, which will be saved in other repositories. This repository will only keep necessary modifications.
